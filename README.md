# Atelier Tools
Tools and libraries for Atelier games by Gust.

Functionality will likely be limited to the Atelier Ryza games, as those are the only ones I own.

## Goals
- Be easier to understand and use than gust_tools
- Support unpacking enough file types to create a decent auto-generated wiki

## Acknowledgements
- [gust_tools](https://github.com/VitaSmith/gust_tools) by [VitaSmith](https://github.com/VitaSmith), which was used to figure out algorithms and file formats.
